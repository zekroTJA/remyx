# Remyx ðŸŽµ

Remyx is a simple web app which lets you create Spotify playlists with your friends which contain a mix of songs of all the source playlists. These playlists are updated daily based on the current content of the source playlists. That way, you can always discover what your friends are currently listening to! ðŸŽµ

## Demo

If you want to try it yourself, feel free to test it out at [remyx.zekro.de](https://remyx.zekro.de).

> **Warning**  
> But watch out, this app is still in a very early stage of development and bugs are to be expected!

## Why not just use blends?

Spotify allows premium users to create "Blends" with your friends which are auto-updating playlists containing songs you both like.

These are the main differences between Remyxes and Blends.
- Remyxes can be created between all sorts of playlists.
- Remyxes can contain as many playlists as you want.
- Remyxes are also available for non-premium users.
- Remyxes are not based on any algorithm which matches what you like, just raw mixes of the source playlists.
