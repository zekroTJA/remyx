# Remyx ðŸŽµ

Remyx is a simple web app which lets you create Spotify playlists with your friends which contain a mix of songs of all the source playlists. These playlists are updated daily based on the current content of the source playlists. That way, you can always discover what your friends are currently listening to! ðŸŽµ
